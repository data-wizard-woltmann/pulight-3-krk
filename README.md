PySpark can into space!


This is the notebook from 19th December 2018 presentation @ Zendesk Sell. It goes together with text files that contain scraped Wikipedia articles (New Horizons, Pluto, Planet, Dwarf planet) from Q4 2018 and Q4 2014. Kudos to Marcin Mycek for scraping!

The notebook contains additional code (compared to the code in the presentation) eg. Seaborn code for visualisation.
If you have additional questions feel free to reach me!


Have fun!
